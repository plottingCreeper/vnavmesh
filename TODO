- better pathfind
-- navmesh debug visu for the process
-- remove reliance on follow tool
-- use same string-pulling idea for navvolumes
-- remove unneeded libs
-- follow/target update
- optimize memory used by voxelmap pathfind query
- navmesh caching
-- do not store intermediates unless needed for debug
-- navmesh caching per zone (terr-id + cfcid + filtered festivals)
-- per-zone custom markup (tighter borders? shapes to ignore?)
- walk/fly transitions
- figure out max-climb and ch (max-climb should be 0.5wu, do we need an extra voxel?)
- optimize voxelization
-- figure out fly bounds (0x2021 material planes)
-- just rewrite this shit and add unittest to compare with recast
- volume nav:
-- configurable voxelmap resolution
-- consider building equivalent of navmesh
--- do we even need any compact representation? connectivity sounds hard for 3d spans...
--- watershed-like partitioning - should be easy
--- contour tracing - moderate?
--- contour simplification - easy
--- building simple polys - moderate?
--- earcut triangulation - easy?
--- theta* on mesh - easy?
- jump / drop markup (offmesh connections?)
- area transitions & high-level zone graph
